PointFree URL Form Coding
==========================

This software contains code originally developed by Point-Free, Inc. and subsequent 
improvements and additions by Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp.

Original Work (Copyright 2017 Point-Free, Inc.):
-------------------------------------------------
- Core PointFreeFormEncoder implementation
- Core PointFreeFormDecoder implementation  
- Basic URL form encoding/decoding functionality
- Original parsing strategies

Improvements and Additions (Copyright 2025 Coen ten Thije Boonkkamp):
----------------------------------------------------------------------
As of commit 20c0617 and onwards:

Core Improvements:
- Fixed optional array decoding with bracketsWithIndices strategy
- Fixed nested array parsing with bracketsWithIndices strategy
- Added encoding strategies (accumulateValues, bracketsWithIndices) to encoder
- Added special handling for Decimal type encoding/decoding
- Fixed brackets (without indices) strategy implementation
- Improved error messages with CustomStringConvertible conformance
- Added strategy auto-detection functionality
- Added PointFreeFormDecoder.decodeWithAutoDetection for automatic strategy detection
- Added .brackets array encoding/parsing strategy for PHP/Rails/Mailgun compatibility
- Converted all strategies to extensible struct-based implementations:
  - EncodingStrategy → ArrayEncodingStrategy (struct with closure)
  - ParsingStrategy → ArrayParsingStrategy (struct with closure)
  - DataEncodingStrategy → struct with closure
  - DataDecodingStrategy → struct with closure
  - DateEncodingStrategy → struct with closure
  - DateDecodingStrategy → struct with closure
- Enabled third-party custom strategies through public initializers
- Improved API clarity by renaming strategies to match their purpose

Test Suite:
- Comprehensive test suite with 149 tests covering:
  - Optional array decoding tests
  - Round-trip encoding/decoding tests
  - Strategy mismatch tests
  - Thread safety tests
  - URLComponents integration tests
  - Decimal and NSNumber type tests
  - Custom parsing strategy tests
  - Backwards compatibility tests
  - Error ergonomics tests
  - Auto-detection tests
  - Performance and memory tests
  - Security tests

All improvements maintain backward compatibility with the original Point-Free implementation
while significantly enhancing functionality, reliability, and developer experience.
